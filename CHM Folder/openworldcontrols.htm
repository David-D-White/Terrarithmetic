<b>Open World Controls</b>
<p>The controls of the Open World game consist of the arrow keys and the space bar. The arrow keys move the play in the corresponding direction as movement, and the space bar is used to interact with certain objects or characters. The Open World game also consists of key shortcuts. When the user presses 'p' on the keyboard, this opens the pause menu. The user can navigate through the pause menu with the arrow keys and select an option with the space bar.</p>
