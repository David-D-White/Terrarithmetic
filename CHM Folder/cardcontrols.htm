<b>Card Game Controls</b>
<p>There are 4 buttons and 2 decks displayed on the screen during the card game. The 2 decks consist of a deck for operators and buttons. The user can navigate through these decks by pressing the current card displayed on the deck. The user can then place a card (either a number or an operator) by selecting one of the buttons. The green buttons place numbers on either the first or third slot of the board and the blue button place operators in the center of the player's board when pressed. The enter button will submit the player's cards on the board and calculate the total points.</p>
